### What is this? ###

This is a branch/snapshot when I finished my graduation work. The framework has evolved a lot by now and Flex is completely removed from the master branch at the moment.

I recently, branched this from the latest commit I made for my graduation work and changed it so it has proper project generation.
As you might notice, there are some resource leaks, possible problematic warnings,... . The purpose of this branch is simply to have a functional result.

### Build Instructions ###

In "scripts", run one of the batch files of choice to generate a visual studio solution.
All references should be setup correctly.

### External Libraries ###

* Fmod
* Nvidia Flex
